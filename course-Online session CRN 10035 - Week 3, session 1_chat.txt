Good afternoon,sorry for being late, I am on campus and there some internet issues here 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.900
<v Ali Aliyev>
accomplishing activities to reach desired result

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Atlas Alizada>
tasks in order to accomplish with group of people or individually

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Aykhan Eylazov>

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
LLL

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>
but learning language is project

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Saida Veyisli>
there was a problem with blackboard, sorry for being late 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Elshan Maharramli>
it is project because it is our goal and we work hard on it

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Elshan Maharramli>
yes

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.900

yes

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.900

yes, start and end date

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Rafiga Rasulzada>
yes

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Jeyhun Mirzayev>
for example, cap stone project 

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.900
<v Nigar Salayeva>
Yes

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>
door of future

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
yes

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Abbas Bayramov>
yes

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Emin Garayev>

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Ali Aliyev>

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.900

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.900
<v Gunel Gojayeva>
yes

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
serves to an aim

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.900
<v Nigar Mammadli>
it doesn't have an end date

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.900
<v Fidan Maharramli>
I think it depends on the purpose of reading

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
it still serves to a goal which is relaxing or making you sleep

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.900
<v Atlas Alizada>
but it shouldn't have an outcome

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.900
<v Nigar Mammadli>
it doesnt always serve a goal as well

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.900
<v Elshan Maharramli>
if it is just hobby then not project

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>
it isproject in this case

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.900
<v Nigar Salayeva>
recurring activity

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.900
<v Aykhan Eylazov>
yes, if it is a hobby, it will not be considered as a project

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
What if you are reading a book to give a webinar?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.900
<v Ali Shukurov>
habit

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Atlas Alizada>
if we read a book for our papers or thesis it is a project

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.900
<v Jeyhun Mirzayev>
project

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.900
<v Elshan Maharramli>
then it is projec6

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>
if we have purpose it is project

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.900
<v Elshan Maharramli>
yes now got it 

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.900
<v Nigar Mammadli>
if we have a deadline as well

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.900
<v Aysel Kazimli>
if you expect to have some results at the end then it is a project

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.900
<v Abbas Bayramov>
like extensive reading in some courses it is considered project

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.900
<v Jeyhun Mirzayev>
yes

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.900

<v Gunel Gojayeva>
yes

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
So, if a student studies at ADA because his parents wanted so, it is not a project?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>
habit

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
Okay

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.900
<v Mikayil Afandiyev>
project now

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Aysel Kazimli>
it is a project

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.900
<v Elshan Maharramli>
there is aim 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Elvin Aliyev>
purpose

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.900
<v Aysel Kazimli>
but if we go to the gym everyday to keep fit, then it is not a project?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.900
